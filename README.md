## Prerequisites

- Python
- Django
- Virtual Environment

## How To Set It Up

- Create a virtual environment for your Django project. You can use either `virtualenv` or `virtualenvwrapper` to set this up.
- To use `virtualenvwrapper` on windows run `pip install virtualenvwrapper-win`
- Use `mkvirtualenv yourenv` to create your virtual environment.
- The virtual environment will be activated automatically and you’ll see “(yourenv)” next to the command prompt to designate that. 
- If you start a new command prompt, you’ll need to activate the environment again using `workon yourenv`.
- To create a virtual environment from your bash terminal check this [link](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- cd into the directory in which you would like to run the project.
- git clone https://github.com/MaestroJolly/python_sample_apps.git
- cd into python_sample_apps
- pip install -r requirements.txt
- pip install git+https://github.com/Flutterwave/rave-python.git
- Find `.env-example` file in the cloned directory, edit it and replace the `RAVE_PUBLIC_KEY` and `RAVE_SECRET_KEY` with the one from your [Rave](https://ravesandbox.flutterwave.com/dashboard/settings/apis) Sandbox Dashboard.
- Save it as `.env`, then source using `source .env from bash terminal` or `set .env from Windows Command Prompt/PowerShell Terminal.`
- To start the project locally, run `py manage.py runserver` to start the server.
- Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) to load the apps on your browser.

## Setting Up Webhooks Locally

- Visit [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to signup for an `ngrok` account.
- Download `ngrok` for your current OS [here](https://ngrok.com/download), install it and make it available globally.
- To make it available globally on Windows, Extract the download `ngrok.zip` file to your preferred path. 
- Hit the `Windows + R` buttons simultaneously, Enter this into the input `sysdm.cpl` and press enter.
- Select the Advanced Option, Open the environment variable option, Select the `PATH` variable name, Click Edit, Click New, Then copy the path of the extracted `ngrok` file and paste it there.
- Click ok to save it.
- Go to your `ngrok` dashboard to get your `auth token`.
- Open a new terminal window, cd into the cloned sample apps directory then enter this command `ngrok authtoken <YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>` change the `<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>` to the `auth token` from your dashboard.
- Next enter this command to start your auth server `ngrok http <PROJECT_SERVER_PORT_NUMBER>` say `ngrok http 8000`.
- Now you should see generated `urls` similar to this `http://a5e2530f.ngrok.io` and `https://a5e2530f.ngrok.io`, copy any of them and go to the webhooks [setting](https://ravesandbox.flutterwave.com/dashboard/settings/webhooks) on your rave dashboard.
- Paste the `url` you copied to the webhook input field and add your `webhook` path to it which should look similar to this `http://a5e2530f.ngrok.io/webhook`, then hit save button.
- Your webhook url is now listening for events/requests, `Rave` sends webhook requests for `card`, `account`, `ghana mobile money`, `uganda mobile money` successful transactions and `transfers`, check [here](https://developer.flutterwave.com/reference#webhooks) to understand more.
- Whenever the webhook is triggered the requests is logged to the database, you can find all the logged webhook requests at this [url](http://127.0.0.1:8000/webhook/logs/).
- You can access admin dashboard by going to this url [http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/) to manage the contents, Login using these details `username: admin`, `password: admin`.
